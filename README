# Pocket HTTP
Pocket HTTP is a simple HTTP/HTTPS server implementation written in C. 

The project currently depends only on `gcc` , the C compiler tool-chain, and `openssl-devel`, providing SSL functionality.

The aim of this project is primarily fun and learning. Ultimately it would be neat to take this out for a spin against Apache's `ab` benchmarking tool to see how it stacks up. For now, the focus is just on getting it working.
